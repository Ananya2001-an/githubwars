# 👋 Welcome to GitHubWars 🎮
GitHubWars is a fun project started by **@Ananya2001-an** to cultivate a community full of people who wish to learn coding the fun way. You can compare your GitHub stats with other fellow GitHub users and see how much you have grown on this platform. I wish to take this project to the next level where we can have more fun challenges, rounds, rewards and lots of learning!

## Inspiration 💭
I wanted to make something with which I could learn new skills along the way. I thought that this could be a great way to make people realize how well they are using GitHub. If they are not then they should because there are many developers around the world who use GitHub like there's no tomorrow😂. It's a fact by the way. 

## Vision 🎯
In the future I wish to add much more challenges and fun themes to this game which are still under progress. I wish to use the GitHub api properly for getting accurate results as much as possible and maybe create possibility of generating random GitHub users with whom you can compete, share your wins on social media, and more. But I need help your help to achieve the same. ;)

# How to contribute? 👩‍💻
1. GitPod
2. Local development

> First of all, you need to fork the repository so that you can make changes in your own copy and not directly to the upstream repository. Later you can raise a pull request to merge your changes to the main branch of upstream repo. 

## GitPod
In the cloud-free development environment which will have all the dependencies you need. You can use Gitpod in the cloud. [![Open in GitPod](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-Ready--to--Code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/Ananya2001-an/githubwars)

## Local development
This environment is fully on computer and requires each dependency (for example NodeJS) to be installed and set up, but gives you the most flexibility for customisation.

### Prequisites
- Nodejs
- Git

### Commands
1. Clone your forked repo on your local machine using command `git clone https://github.com/{username}/githubwars.git`
2. Run `npm install` in terminal to install all dependencies mentioned in package.json file.
3. Also create a Personal access token in a `.env` file to use the github api in an authorized manner. You can refer the `.env.example` file for it. On how to create PAT you can refer this link => https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token
4. Finally run `npm run start` script to start the app in dev mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.You may also see any lint errors in the console.
5. After making your changes don't forget to run `npm run lint` or `npm run lint-fix` to fix any linting errors.
